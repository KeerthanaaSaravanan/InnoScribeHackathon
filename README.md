# InnoScribe  
## Smart Learning Assistant for Children with Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD) 


A **software-first solution** leveraging **AI-powered handwriting analysis**, **voice-to-text**, and **personalized feedback** to empower independent writing. Built with **React**, **Flask**, **Firebase**, and **cloud services**, with future hardware integration planned for full offline functionality.

---

## The Problem  
Children with SLD face significant challenges in writing during exams and academics, often relying on scribes, time extensions, or reactive tools. Existing solutions are **costly, inaccessible, or limited** to specific use cases (e.g., calculators for dyscalculia).  

**Innoscribe addresses this by:**  
- Providing **real-time feedback** on handwriting via AI.  
- Enabling **voice-based dictation** for exam-compliant writing.  
- Gamifying practice to build confidence and motor skills.  
- Prioritizing **affordability** and **scalability** through software-first design.

## Features 

###  Dual-Mode Writing System  
- **Dictation Mode**: Convert spoken answers to text using **cloud-based voice recognition** (offline mode planned).  
- **Writing Mode**: AI-driven feedback via **advanced handwriting analysis** (text input for now; hardware integration in future).  

### AI Handwriting Analysis  
- Uses **cloud AI tools** to analyze text-based handwriting data (e.g., letter spacing, stroke order).  
- Provides instant feedback to improve legibility and motor coordination.  

###  Gamified Practice  
- Interactive exercises and progress tracking to make handwriting practice engaging.  
- Tracks performance and suggests personalized exercises.  

###  Secure Authentication & Data Storage  
- **Firebase Authentication** for role-based access (students, educators, parents).  
- **Firestore Database** for storing user data, progress, and analytics.  

###  Cloud-Powered Voice & Text  
- **Cloud APIs** for voice dictation and feedback (seamlessly integrated for clarity and ease of use).
